The application tracks the Stylists working for the salon, and the clients associated with each Stylist. A Stylist may have many Clients, but a client can only be associated with one Stylist. Users are allowed to add, delete, and edit the Stylists working for the salon and to add, delete, and edit the Clients that belong to each Stylist.

3. If not already installed, download: [MySql Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
4. Follow the instruction [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time-c-and-react-track/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql) for configuring MySql. 
5. Open the terminal on your local machine and navigate to where you want to clone the project

* Open MySql Workbench. Once open select the __Administration__ tab. Next select __Data Import/Restore__. This opens up the __Data Import__ window with the __Import from Disk__ tab open. Select the radio button for __Import from Self-Contained File__. Click the button with the three dots (if on windows) or two dots (if on mac) at the end of the path field. This will open a window to search for the sql dump file on your local disk. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project and select __shane_graff.sql__ and click the __open__ buton. Next, press the __New...__ button. This will open a window where you can choose the name of the imported schema. Choose a name appropriate to the project, e.g. ```hairsalon``` and click __Okay__ We'll need this name later when setting up the project to work with this schema. If on a mac, click the __Start Import__ botton. If on a windows machine, switch to the __Import Progress__ tab on the __Data Import__ page. Click the __Import__ button. Finally, re-click on the __Schemas__ tab. Right-click in the __Schemas__ window, and select __Refresh All__. The imported schema should now be listed.
8. Navigate back to the ```HairSalon/``` directory and create a file named: ```appsettings.json```. In this file, add the folling configuration to set up the project to work with the schema you imported: 
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[THE-NAME-YOU-CHOSE-WHEN-IMPORTING-THE-SCHEMA];uid=root;pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}
```
